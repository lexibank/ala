# Automated Language Affiliation (ALA): A Pipeline for Lexibank Data

With ALA, we offer a service for the automated affiliation of a language, based on standardized data from the Lexibank repository for CLDF wordlists. Language Affiliation is hereby understood as the task by which one tries to identify to which language family a given language belongs.
