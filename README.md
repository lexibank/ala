# Automated Language Affiliation (ALA): A Pipeline for Cross-Linguistic Data Formats

With ALA, we offer a service for the automated affiliation of a language, based on standardized data from the Lexibank repository for CLDF wordlists. Language Affiliation is hereby understood as the task by which one tries to identify to which language family a given language belongs. 

# Downloading SQLITE Data for Lexibank, ASJP, and Grambank

Data should be added to Zenodo or OSF, so we don't need to have people compile them.
